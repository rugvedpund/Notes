## What We Know

**Particle Classification by Spin:**

"Intrinsic Angular Momentum". Charged leptons have magnetic moments are characteristic of point-like particles, hadrons have very different magnetic moments. The magnetic moment of a particle is proportional to its spin. 

**Vacuum is not empty:**

QFT vacuum feature. Higgs has a vev.

**Isospin: Another classificaton property**

Leptons consist of three families with individual conserved numbers $L_e, L_\mu, L_\tau$ that satisfies 
$$Q- I_3 = - \frac{1}{2}L$$

This weak charge of leptons is corrrelated with $I_3$. 

### Strong Coupling

Obtained via transverse momentum of the $Z$ boson, and comparison with theory.
