# Dynamical Early Dark Energy

Based on talk by Subinoy Das  at SBU. Work with Vivian Poulin, Tanvi Kharval. 

## Introduction

- $H_0$ tension: CMB vs SH0ES
- CMB: $\theta_s,\theta_d, \theta_{eq}$ sund horizon, angular diameter distanc and 

BAO stops you from modifying $D_A$ the angular diamter distance. So we focus on $r_s$.

Cookbook for $H_0$ :
To increase $H_0$ :
- decreate matter density at late times - not allowed by BAO
- decrease sound speed in the early universe - vey hard
- increase matter density at early times - Early Dark Energy!

if you increase $N_{eff}$ then maybe $r_s$ can be reduced. 1604:01424

If EDE appears, it must disappear too otherwise we just enter a $\Lambda$ dominated phase early and disturbs he normal structure formation in DM-domination.

So a new dynamical dark energy:
