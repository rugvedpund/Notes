Funny story: She worked at the Harvard College Observatory as a "computer" (a person who computes) and was paid 30 cents an hour. She was deaf and had to lip read. She was also a suffragette (_a woman seeking the right to vote through organized protest, a term originating in Britain to mock women fighting for the right to vote_) and was arrested for picketing the White House in 1917. She died of cancer in 1921. Hubble mentioned that she should have won the Nobel Prize, but Nobel Prizes are and were not awarded posthumously.

She found that larger amplitude Cepheids had longer periods. She also found that the brighter Cepheids had longer periods. She found that the period was related to the luminosity of the Cepheid. This is the Leavitt Law.

The Leavitt Law is a relation between the period of a Cepheid and its luminosity. It was discovered by Henrietta Leavitt in 1908. The relation is given by:

$$M_V = -2.81(\pm0.03) \log_{10} P - 1.43(\pm0.08)$$

where $M_V$ is the absolute magnitude in the V-band and $P$ is the period in days. The scatter in the relation is about 0.2 mag. The relation is valid for periods between 1 and 50 days.
