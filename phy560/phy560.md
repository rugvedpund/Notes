#### Neutrino Observatories

JUNO: Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory. Aims to determine neutrino mass heirarchy and precision measurements of PMNS matrix elements.

>PMNS matrix: Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix. Analogous to CKM matrix for quarks.
>
> Each flavor eigenstate can be written as a linear combination of mass eigenstates. The PMNS matrix is the unitary matrix that relates the two bases. 
> $$ \begin{pmatrix} \nu_e \\ \nu_\mu \\ \nu_\tau \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} U_{e1} & U_{e2} & U_{e3} \\ U_{\mu1} & U_{\mu2} & U_{\mu3} \\ U_{\tau1} & U_{\tau2} & U_{\tau3} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \nu_1 \\ \nu_2 \\ \nu_3 \end{pmatrix} $$
> In SM, PMNS matrix is unitary. In other models like seesaw, majorana mass, etc. it is not. Simple extensions involve a fourth, light sterile neutrino.
>
> In general, 9 real degrees of freedom. In case of PMNS, 5 can be absorbed into the phases of the fields. 3 mixing angles ($\theta_{12},\theta_{23},\theta_{13}$) and 1 CP violating phase ($\delta$). In this basis, the matrix can be written as:
>$$ U = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & c_{23} & s_{23} \\ 0 & -s_{23} & c_{23} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} c_{13} & 0 & s_{13}e^{-i\delta} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -s_{13}e^{i\delta} & 0 & c_{13} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} c_{12} & s_{12} & 0 \\ -s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $$

- mass ordering. natural to think the same as leptons $e<\mu<\tau$, but is not necessarily. Normal heirarchy preffered oer inverted, 2 sigma. Soon, 3 sigma. Within 10-15 years , we will know - Chang Kee
- Two big experiments coming up: Fermilab. Japan.

> Fun fact: Barry thought he would be a tennis player, or a novelist as a kid. Then he has moved around physics a lot too. Point is, it is not hard to move around in physics.

#### Particle Physics 2000s

- APS - Particles and Fields. 2000, study of the future of particle physics. Barish and John Bagger. First figure is now the definitioin of particle physics.
- Connecting Quarks with Cosmos, 2003. pose "eleven questions for the new century"

### Chapter 1: Where we are and where we can be?

>Principia: best book on science ever written. -Barry.
>Primarily helped Newton predict Halley's comet.

- Standard Model for Particle Physics: 3 generations of quarks and leptons. 4 forces. Higgs boson.
- Cosmology: Big Bang, Inflation, Dark Matter, Dark Energy

### Chapter 2: Matter, Space, and Time

- Twin Revolutions: Quantum Mechanics and Relativity
- Why particle dominated universe? Why not anti-particle? Look up Sakharov conditions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryogenesis

>#### Neutrino CP-violation
>
>Notes from https://neutrinos.fnal.gov/mysteries/cp-violation/.
>In physics everything is invariant under CPT. CPT Theorem! Thus, for every process there is a mirror process with an antiparticle. If CP violated, then we can create more matter than antimatter. This is baryogenesis.

>Almost everyone believes proton has to be unstable. -Barry

- why three gens
- why quark masses are so different

> Villa d Este is cool af. Interesting forum: https://www.ambrosetti.eu/en/summit-event/intelligence-on-the-world-europe-and-italy/

>#### Why muon collider?
>
>- can go to higher energies
>- electrons radiate synchrotron, bremmstrahlung. So gotta use larger radii, or it;s a losing battle. Technically, $e^+/e^-$ >collisions are clean so would have been preferred.
>- muons are 200 times heavier than electrons, so they radiate ? >times less.
>- References: CERN courier, SNOMASS report
>- neutrino contamination is a problem for muon. muon decays make neutrinos, they will be at ~TeV energies. So need to be careful >about that.

>HW Problem: predict the top quark mass!

> Top Quark
>
> - top quark weighs almost as much as a gold atom!
> 

>SUSY
>
> - Unification of forces just slightly does not work out without SUSY. Look for plot where at higher energies, unification looks ugly
> - SUSY could solve DM
> - Also solves the heirarchy problem. SUSY particles have not been found yet. So if they exist, they are heavy. So SUSY is not a solution to the heirarchy problem.

> General Relativity

> blah blah blah


### Chapter 3: How are Matter, Space and Time unified?
