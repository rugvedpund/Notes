# Chess Attacking Visualizer

## Central Idea

To highlight squares that are attacked and defended by one (or several colors) and then hide the pieces to demonstrate:
- weak pawns and pieces
- space advantages
- mobilty 
- potentially weak squares that are attacked more than defended

Optionally, tactics vision might be better if attacking squares "see through" pawns and pieces to show discovered attacking ideas better.

Optionally, tactics vision might be improved by reducing the attacking power of a piece if it is responsible for defending another piece. And vice versa.

**This should clearly identify material advantage.**

## Issues

Mating vision is probably missing because there is no way to identify what is a mate.
