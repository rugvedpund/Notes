# Crash Course

##  Structures

Common structures in procedural programming:
1. Sequential 
1. Conditional
1. Loops

> lol baba says "my-mik" for mimic

"Everything is an object". Every `object` has:
- identity
- responsibility
- behaviour

defined as a `class`. Called object-oriented programming. 

Maintainabiity:
- Find what can change/break and isolate it 
- Subclassing to override functions of parent class

Good "Object Oriented Design" how to relate objects statically and dynamically.

## Refactoring Guidelines

Also, Python PEP8 Guidelines

## Software Engineering

For very large codebases. When codes become projecs themselves. 

Requirements -> Design -> Test?

But never have all requirements together. Also initial presumptions make design very rigid. So need some continuous development model = `Agile`

"Do it small, do it repeatedly"

Small piece oriented development. Improves communication between teams, small commits. That's why Agile. 

Agile talks about flow management rather than product management, because software is never "done". `Kanban` is useful for flow management. 

DevOps - Operations people sit next to development team.

## Tools

Need automatic testing. IDEs for testing?!

## UML Sequence Diagram

Create a UML diagram for normalizing flows. Don't read too much.
