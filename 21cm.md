# 21cm and Detailed Balance

## Abstract

Notes on the 21cm line and the principle of detailed balance. In particular, we are interested to know if we can write down the usual 21cm spin temperature equation for neutrino interactions, and the conditions that are required to do so.

## 21cm Physics

The 21cm line is a hyperfine transition between the two states of the $1s$ of neutral hydrogen. The energy difference between these states is $E_{21} = 5.9 \times 10^{-6}$ eV. The lifetime of the excited state is long, $\tau_{21} \sim 10^7$ years.

Three processes determine the spin temperature of the 21cm line: 
1. Absorption/emission of CMB photons
1. Collisions with H atoms, free electrons, and protons
1. ~~Absorption/emission of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons~~ (not relevant for redshifts relevant for neutrinos)

The rate of these processes is fast compared to the lifetime of the 21cm line, and so the populations of the states are in equilibrium. In this limit, the spin temperature is given by the expression (which we will derive):

$$\begin{equation}
T_S^{-1} = \frac{T_\gamma^{-1} + x_c T_K^{-1} + x_\alpha T_K^{-1}}{1 + x_c + x_\alpha} \sim \frac{T_\gamma^{-1}+x_cT_K^{-1}}{1+x_c}
\end{equation}$$

where we will drop the $\alpha$ term from now on. $T_\gamma$ is the CMB temperature, $T_K$ is the kinetic temperature of the gas, and $x_c$ is the collisional coupling coefficient. The spin temperature becomes strongly coupled to the kinetic temperature when $x_c+x_\alpha \gg 1$ and relaxes to $T_\gamma$ when $x_c+x_\alpha \ll 1$. The collisional coupling coefficient is given in the Pritchard and Loeb review [arxiv:1109.6012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6012) eqn. 10 and references therein. The rest of the review talks in detail about Ly-$\alpha$ coupling, which is not relevant for neutrinos.

From the P&L review $\S$ 3.1: An important feature of $T_S$ is that the dependence saturates at some point. For example, when the Ly-$\alpha$ flux is strong enough, any further increase in the Ly-$\alpha$ flux does not increase the spin temperature. This leads to conceptually distinct regimes for the spin temperature: the Ly-$\alpha$ coupling dominated regime, the collisional coupling dominated regime, and the CMB coupling dominated regime.

From the Furlanetto review [arxiv:1909.13740](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13740) In the presence of CMB alone, the spin states reach equilibrium on a time-scale of $\sim 10^5$ years. In the presence of collisions, the spin states reach equilibrium on a time-scale of ? years. _I need to find this timescale to complete the argument, but I assume it is $\ll\tau_{21}=10^7$ years._ Thus, we conclude that all relevant processes adjust on time-scales much shorter than the lifetime of the 21cm line, and so the populations of the states are in equilibrium. 

>Neutrinos clearly interact on longer time-scales than the 21cm line lifetime, so we can assume that the populations of the states are NOT in equilibrium. This is a clear problem!

Since the populations of each state, $n_1$ and $n_0$, are in equilibrium, we can write down the rate equations for the transitions between the states. The rate equation for $n_1$ (similarly for $n_1$) is:

$$\begin{align}
\frac{dn_0}{dt} = (A_{10}+B_{10}I_{CMB}+C_{10}) n_1 &- (B_{01}I_{CMB}+C_{01})n_0 = 0 \ \text{in equilibrium} \\
\therefore (A_{10}+B_{10}I_{CMB}+C_{10}) n_1 &= (B_{01}I_{CMB}+C_{01})n_0 \\
\end{align}$$ 

where $A_{10}$ is the spontaneous emission rate, $B_{10}$ is the stimulated emission rate, $B_{01}$ is the stimulated absorption rate, $C_{10}$ is the collisional excitation rate, and $C_{01}$ is the collisional de-excitation rate. $I_{CMB}$ is the intensity of the CMB at the frequency of the 21cm line.

Einstein relations associate the stimulated emission and absorption rates with the spontaneous emission rate:
$$B_{10} = \frac{g_0}{g_1} \frac{c^2}{2h\nu^3} A_{10} = \frac{g_0}{g_1} B_{01}$$

where $g_0$ and $g_1$ are the degeneracies of the two states, $g_0 = 1$ and $g_1 = 3$. For the 21cm transition, $A_{10} = 2.85 \times 10^{-15} \text{s}^{-1}$.[^1]
[^1]: An excellent short video of a review of these concepts by Aaron Parsons, UC Berkeley is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYpEtF2H-k).

Since the populations are in equilibrium, we can write down the ratio of the populations of the two states and define the spin temperature:
$$ \frac{n_1}{n_0} \equiv \frac{g_1}{g_0} \exp \Big( {-\dfrac{E_{21}}{k_B T_S}} \Big) = 3 \exp\Big({-\dfrac{h\nu_{21}}{k_B T_S}}\Big)$$

where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. 

It is conventional to replace the CMB intensity with the CMB temperature, 
$$I_{CMB} = \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{(e^{h\nu/k_B T_\gamma} - 1)} \sim \frac{2k_B\nu^2T_\gamma}{c^2}$$
This is valid in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit, $h\nu \ll k_B T_\gamma$. In this limit, the CMB temperature is $T_\gamma = 2.725(1+z)$ K. In our case, the frequency of the 21cm line is $\nu_{21} = 1420$ MHz, and so the Rayleigh-Jeans limit is valid since $T_{21}=h\nu_{21}/k_B = 5.9 \times 10^{-6}/k_B = 0.068$ K $\ll T_\gamma$ for all redshifts relevant for 21cm physics. 

## Detailed Balance and Derivation of Spin Temperature Equation

The principle of detailed balance states that for a process that can be decomposed into disjoint elementary processes, the rate of each elementary process is equal to the rate of its inverse process in equilibrium. Further, the distributions of the populations in equilibrium is a Boltzmann distribution. In our case, the elementary processes are the photon interactions (spontaneous and stimulated emission/absorption) and collisional interaction (excitation/de-excitation). 

Rewriting,
$$\begin{align}
% \frac{B_{01} I_{CMB}}{A_{10}+B_{10}I_{CMB}} &= \frac{g_1}{g_0} \exp{\Big(-\frac{T_{21}}{T_\gamma}}\Big) \sim 3\Big(1-\frac{T_{21}}{T_\gamma}\Big)\\
\frac{C_{01}}{C_{10}} &= \frac{g_1}{g_0} \exp{\Big(-\frac{T_{21}}{T_K}}\Big) \sim 3\Big(1-\frac{T_{21}}{T_K}\Big)
\end{align}$$

Now, we can write down the spin temperature equation by combining the two equations above:
$$\begin{align}
\frac{n_1}{n_0}=3\Big(1-\frac{T_{21}}{T_S}\Big) &= \frac{B_{01} I_{CMB} + C_{01}}{A_{10}+B_{10}I_{CMB} + C_{10}} =   \frac{ \frac{B_{01}}{A_{10}}I_{CMB} + \frac{C_{01}}{A_{10}} }{1+\frac{B_{10}}{A_{10}}I_{CMB} + \frac{C_{10}}{A_{10}}}\\

\end{align}$$

## Considerations for Neutrinos

- Detailed balance is valid when there is time-reversal symmetry. This is a delicate case for the neutrinos.
- Neutrino coupling should depend on the neutrino temperature as well as the gas temperature, so the term would be dependent on the _effective_ temperature perhaps like the one in the Dhuria DM paper.
