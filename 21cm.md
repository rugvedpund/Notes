# 21cm and Detailed Balance

## Abstract

Notes on the 21cm line and the principle of detailed balance. In particular, we are interested to know if we can write down the usual 21cm spin temperature equation for neutrino interactions, and the conditions that are required to do so.

## 21cm Physics

The 21cm line is a hyperfine transition between the $n=1$ and $n=2$ states of neutral hydrogen. The energy difference between these states is $\Delta E_{21} = 5.9 \times 10^{-6}$ eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of 21cm. The transition is forbidden [^1], and so the lifetime of the excited state is long, $\tau \sim 10^7$ years [^2]. 

Three processes determine the spin temperature of the 21cm line: 
1. Absorption/emission of CMB photons
1. Collisions with H atoms, free electrons, and protons
1. ~~Absorption/emission of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons~~ (not relevant for redshifts relevant for neutrinos)

The rate of these processes is fast compared to the lifetime of the 21cm line, and so the populations of the states are in equilibrium. In this limit, the spin temperature is given by the usual expression:

$$T_S^{-1} = \frac{T_\gamma^{-1} + x_c T_K^{-1} + x_\alpha T_K^{-1}}{1 + x_c + x_\alpha}$$

where we will drop the $\alpha$ term for now. $T_\gamma$ is the CMB temperature, $T_K$ is the kinetic temperature of the gas, and $x_c$ is the collisional coupling coefficient. The spin temperature becomes strongly coupled to the kinetic temperature when $x_c+x_\alpha \gg 1$ and relaxes to $T_\gamma$ when $x_c+x_\alpha \ll 1$. The collisional coupling coefficient is given in the Pritchard and Loeb review [http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6012) eqn. 10 and references therein.

From the P&L review $\S$ 3.1:
>An important feature of $T_S$ is that the dependence saturates at some point. For example, when the Ly-$\alpha$ flux is strong enough, any further increase in the Ly-$\alpha$ flux does not increase the spin temperature. This leads to conceptually distinct regimes for the spin temperature: the Ly-$\alpha$ coupling dominated regime, the collisional coupling dominated regime, and the CMB coupling dominated regime.

**I assume this also holds for the gas collisional couplings from the following statement, but I have not explicitly checked this.**








We will derive this expression using the principle of detailed balance.

In a typical Boltzmann problem, there are two time scales: the time scale of the system, and the time scale of the interactions. The time scale of the system is the time scale over which the populations of the states change. The time scale of the interactions is the time scale over which the system reaches equilibrium. The time scale of the system is typically much longer than the time scale of the interactions. In this case, we can use the principle of detailed balance to write down the Boltzmann equation for the populations of the states.



[^1]: The transition is forbidden because the electron spin does not change. The electron spin is parallel to the proton spin in the ground state, and anti-parallel in the excited state. The transition is therefore forbidden by the selection rule $\Delta S = 0$.
