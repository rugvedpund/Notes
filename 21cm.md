# 21cm and Detailed Balance

## Abstract

Notes on the 21cm line and the principle of detailed balance. In particular, we are interested to know if we can write down the usual 21cm spin temperature equation for neutrino interactions, and the conditions that are required to do so.

## 21cm Physics

The 21cm line is a hyperfine transition between the two states of the $1s$ of neutral hydrogen. The energy difference between these states is $E_{21} = 5.9 \times 10^{-6}$ eV. The lifetime of the excited state is long, $\tau \sim 10^7$ years.

Three processes determine the spin temperature of the 21cm line: 
1. Absorption/emission of CMB photons
1. Collisions with H atoms, free electrons, and protons
1. ~~Absorption/emission of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons~~ (not relevant for redshifts relevant for neutrinos)

The rate of these processes is fast compared to the lifetime of the 21cm line, and so the populations of the states are in equilibrium. In this limit, the spin temperature is given by the expression (which we will derive):

$$T_S^{-1} = \frac{T_\gamma^{-1} + x_c T_K^{-1} + x_\alpha T_K^{-1}}{1 + x_c + x_\alpha}$$

where we will drop the $\alpha$ term from now on. $T_\gamma$ is the CMB temperature, $T_K$ is the kinetic temperature of the gas, and $x_c$ is the collisional coupling coefficient. The spin temperature becomes strongly coupled to the kinetic temperature when $x_c+x_\alpha \gg 1$ and relaxes to $T_\gamma$ when $x_c+x_\alpha \ll 1$. The collisional coupling coefficient is given in the Pritchard and Loeb review [arxiv:1109.6012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6012) eqn. 10 and references therein. The rest of the review talks in detail about Ly-$\alpha$ coupling, which is not relevant for neutrinos.

From the P&L review $\S$ 3.1: An important feature of $T_S$ is that the dependence saturates at some point. For example, when the Ly-$\alpha$ flux is strong enough, any further increase in the Ly-$\alpha$ flux does not increase the spin temperature. This leads to conceptually distinct regimes for the spin temperature: the Ly-$\alpha$ coupling dominated regime, the collisional coupling dominated regime, and the CMB coupling dominated regime.

**I assume this also holds for the gas collisional couplings from the following statement, but I have not explicitly checked this**

From the Furlanetto review [arxiv:1909.13740](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13740) In the presence of CMB alone, the spin states reach equilibrium on a time-scale of $\sim 10^5$ years. In the presence of collisions, the spin states reach equilibrium on a time-scale of $\sim 10^3$ years. In the presence of Ly-$\alpha$ photons, the spin states reach equilibrium on a time-scale of $\sim 10^2$ years. **Verify!**

Thus, we conclude that all relevant processes adjust on time-scales much shorter than the lifetime of the 21cm line, and so the populations of the states are in equilibrium. 

## Detailed Balance

Since the populations of each state, $n_1$ and $n_0$, are in equilibrium, we can write down the rate equations for the transitions between the states. The rate equation for $n_1$ (similarly for $n_1$) is:

$$
\frac{dn_0}{dt} = (A_{10}+B_{10}I_{CMB}+C_{10}) n_1 - (B_{01}I_{CMB}+C_{01})n_0 = 0 \ \text{in equilibrium}
$$ (1)

where $A_{10}$ is the spontaneous emission rate, $B_{10}$ is the stimulated emission rate, $B_{01}$ is the stimulated absorption rate, $C_{10}$ is the collisional excitation rate, and $C_{01}$ is the collisional de-excitation rate. $I_{CMB}$ is the intensity of the CMB at the frequency of the 21cm line.

Einstein relations associate the stimulated emission and absorption rates with the spontaneous emission rate:
$$B_{10} = \frac{g_0}{g_1} \frac{c^2}{2h\nu^3} A_{10} = \frac{g_0}{g_1} B_{01}$$

where $g_0$ and $g_1$ are the degeneracies of the two states, $g_0 = 1$ and $g_1 = 3$. For the 21cm transition, $A_{10} = 2.85 \times 10^{-15} \text{s}^{-1}$.[^1]

Since the populations are in equilibrium, we can write down the ratio of the populations of the two states and define the spin temperature:
$$ \frac{n_1}{n_0} \equiv \frac{g_1}{g_0} \exp \Big( {-\dfrac{E_{21}}{k_B T_S}} \Big) = 3 \exp\Big({-\dfrac{h\nu}{k_B T_S}}\Big)$$

where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.
