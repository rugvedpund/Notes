# Evolution of Alternate Cosmologies

## Introduction

Notes from the review by J. Naralikar https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2001ASPC..252..175N

## Early Ideas

>There is one trait which old cosmologists share with the modern ones viz. their fond wish that the mysteries of the universe be solves in their lifetime. This trait has led to the caustic comment *Cosmologists are always wrong but never in doubt*. -J. Narlikar

- 1900s: Solar System is at the center of Milky Way

What is mainstream cosmology may change with epoch. Prior to 1900s, even during the first decade of 20th century: Solar System is ar the centre of the Milky Way. 
Then, accurate distances to stars and globular lusters by Harlow Shapley led to the realization that the Sun is not at the centre of the Milky Way. Solar System is around 30k ly from the centre of the Milky Way, about $2/3^{\text{rd}}$ of the way out from the centre.

- 1920s: Milky Way is the only galaxy "Island Universe"

"... observation and discussion of the radial velocities, internal motions and distribution of spiral nebulae, of th real and apparent brightness of novae, of the maximum luminsity of galactic and cluster stars, and finally of the dimensions of our galactic system, all seem to definitely oppose the 'island universe' hypothesis of spiral nebulae." - Shapely, 1919. Island Universe originated in 18th century due to Immanuel Kant. By 1925, Leavitt and Hubble allowed this alternate view to become established.

## Beginning of modern cosmology

- 1917: Einstein - Universe is static

Einstein assumed that universe was homogenous, isotropic and *static*. Infamously, introducing the $\Lambda$ term to make the universe static. Against this, de Sitter (1917), Friedmann (1922,1924) and Lemaitre (1927) proposed a solution to Einstein's equations which was homogenous, isotropic and *dynamic*. Robertson (1928) also calculated a valocity-distance relation for these models. Of course, ignored as esoteric mathematical curiosities.

- 1929: Hubble's Law

Expanding universe becomes mainstream. Einstein's regret: "The cosmological constant is the biggest blunder of my life." Also, Robertson (1935) and Walker (1936) independently showed from group-theory arguments that the following line element could be drived for a homogenous, isotropic and dynamic universe:
$$ds^2 = c^2dt^2 - R^2(t) \left[ \frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2} + r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2) \right]$$
where $k$ is a constant. This is the Robertson-Walker metric. Here, $r,\theta,\phi$ are comoving (constant) coordinates of the *fundamental observer* and $t$ their proper time. The existence of the fundamental observers that respect homogeneity and isotropy makes $t$ the *cosmic time*. $R(t)$ is the scale factor. $k=0$ corresponds to a flat universe, $k=1$ to a closed universe and $k=-1$ to an open universe.

- 1930s: Newtonian Cosmology

McCrea and Milne (1934) that almost exact analogues of the Robertson-Walker metric can be derived from Newtonian theory. Same dynamical behaviour, except the curvature parameter $k$ is replaced with 'total energy', where positive total energy corresponds  to the model expanding to infinity, negative energy contraction to a big crunch at finite time and zero energy model is flat $k=0$ model that contracts to the big crunch at $t=\infty$.

Newtonian model can be extended to hot radiation-dominated phase (Narlikar 1996). Peebles (1971) also showed that a lot of physical cosmology of the early universe can be done in the Newtonian framework and recovers key features.

Conceptually however, only valid for low-velocity, weak gravitation limit. Cosmology probes beyond these limits. Velocity addition does not work, and Poisson equation is not valid with boundary conditions at infinity.
