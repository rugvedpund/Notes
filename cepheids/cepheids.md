# Cepheids

## Introduction

Notes based on the excellent review of conference proceedings by Wendy Freedman and Barry Madore: Cepheids: Past, Present and Future (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02474.pdf)

## Henrietta Leavitt

>Story Time: She worked at the Harvard College Observatory as a "computer" (a person who computes) and was paid 30 cents an hour. She was also a suffragette (_a woman seeking the right to vote through organized protest, a term originating in Britain to mock women fighting for the right to vote_) and was arrested for picketing the White House in 1917. She died of cancer in 1921. Hubble mentioned that she should have won the Nobel Prize, but Nobel Prizes are and were not awarded posthumously. Before Leavitt the only way to measure distances was using parallax. This only works for nearby stars. If a star was dim, there was no other way to tell if it was just dim or actually further away


### Timeline of Cepheid Developments

- **1908**: Leavitt Law, 25 Cepheids
- **1923-26**: Hubble Law, M31, M33 and NGC 6822
- **1950s**: Cepheids in the Milky Way clusters, 
- **1960s**: Wisniewski & Johnson's photoelectric $UBVRIJKL$ (_astronomers and their alphabets!_) photometry of Milky Way Cepheids:
    1. Decrease in amplitude from UV to IR
    1. Shift in relative phase of maximum light, from UV to IR
- **1970-90s**: $H_0$ "factor-of-two" debate: 50 or 100 km/s/Mpc
- **2001**: HST Key Project: $H_0$ = 72 $\pm$ 8 km/s/Mpc, Freedman et al. 2001

Cepheid measurements are still non-trivial:
- Crowding and confusion. 
- Presence of dust, which can scatter/absorb radiation. Cepheids are often found in dusty regions because they are young stars and haven't had time to clear out the dust in their neighborhood.
- Metallicity: may affect the luminosity

## Cepheid Properties

### IR is good:

Decrease in width is primarily due to decrease in sensitivity of the infrared surface brightness to the intrinsic temperature width of the instability strip. 

>The instability strip is the region in the HR diagram where stars are unstable. The width of the instability strip is the range of temperatures where stars are unstable. The surface brightness is the brightness of the star as seen from Earth. The intrinsic temperature width is the range of temperatures that the star has. The sensitivity of the infrared surface brightness is how much the brightness of the star changes as the temperature changes.

### CCDs are good:

Local sky subtraction is easy, point spread function fitting can be done. Easier to handle crowding and confusion. Large wavelength coverage. Allowed the first and direct determination of reddening.

>Reddening: Dust in the Milky Way can absorb and scatter light. This is a problem for Cepheids because they are often found in dusty regions. The reddening is wavelength dependent and is also a function of distance.
